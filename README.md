A little C++11 sandbox.

Need to be a bit organized around tests.

Everything *should* compile with:
    - clang++ >= clang version 3.1 (trunk 150359)
    - g++ >= gcc-4.8-20120311

Note: some intricate code are because of compiler bugs/limitation in C++11 support.

Note again:

You do what the hell you want with all the code present in this repository.

BUT DON'T COME BACK WHINING IF IT DOESN'T WORK.

However, if you want to talk about C++ in a peaceful way feel free to contact
me (bombela@gmail.com), I always nicer around a beer too :)
