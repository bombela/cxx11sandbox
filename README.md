A little C++11 sandbox.

You will find in it mostly experimentation like:
 - ranges
 - properties
 - coroutines
 - generators
 - async-io with coroutines...

All of that, just for fun.

Everything *may* compile with:

    - clang++ >= version 3.2 (trunk 164880)
    - g++ >= 4.8.0 20120923 (experimental)
